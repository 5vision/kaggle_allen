The already computed wiki glove word2vec is used co calculate cosine similaruty of questions and answers.
Scores are around 0.31875
Run:
- get glove data - fetch_glove_data.sh
- get prediciton - glove_predict.py

2)IR based part:
Retrivieng ck12 topics, then get wiki pages for each page and then ranking documents for question and answer pair.
Scores are around 0.35375.
Run:
To get wiki pages and prediction - python ck12_wiki_predict.py --get_data 1
